# Hello world!

    **Everything** supported in a `.md` file is also supported here!

    There is _zero_ runtime overhead.

    In addition, Astro supports:
    - Astro {expressions}
    - Automatic indentation normalization
    - Automatic escaping of expressions inside code blocks

    ```js
      // This content is not transformed!
      const object = { someOtherValue };
    ```
